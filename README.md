# Autonomous Driving Challenge

![](videos/images_and_angles.gif)



 Your method should return a trained neural network class. An example class (from the Neural Networks module) is included in `sample_student.py`. Your submitted script should also inlcude a `NeuralNetwork()` class - you are free to modify this class or write your own from scratch. You'll also need to create a predict method:

## The Data
Download training data [here](http://www.welchlabs.io/unccv/autonomous_driving/data/training.zip). 

## Packages
For this challenge you are only permitted to use numpy, opencv, tdqm, time, and scipy. Tensorflow and other high level ML tools are not permitted.

### Grading 

| RMSE (degrees)   | Points (10 max)  | 
| ------------- | ------------- | 
| RMSE <= 12.5     | 10  | 
| 12.5 < RMSE <= 15 | 9  |  
| 15 < RMSE <= 20 | 8  |   
| 20 < RMSE <= 25 | 7  |   
| 25 < RMSE <= 30 | 6  |   
| 30 < RMSE <= 40 | 5  |  
| RMSE > 40, or code fails to run | 4  |
